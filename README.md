  ## Description
  What is Node.js design for?  Node.js utilizes the JavaScript engine, which is developed by Google for use in the Chrome web browser. This allows developers to write server-side code in JavaScript, enabling full-stack development with a single language, reducing context-switching overhead, and allowing for code reuse between client and server.
